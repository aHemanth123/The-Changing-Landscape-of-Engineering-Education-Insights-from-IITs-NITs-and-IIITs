 # 📊 The Changing Landscape of Engineering Education  
**Insights from IITs, NITs, and IIITs (2016–2023)**

A comprehensive data visualization and analysis project showcasing admission trends across premier Indian engineering institutes. Built using Power BI, this dashboard-driven exploration helps uncover patterns in opening and closing ranks across categories, years, institutes, and rounds.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To investigate trends in seat allocation, category-wise competitiveness, and institutional demand across **IITs, NITs, and IIITs** from 2016 to 2023 using JoSAA seat matrix and rank data.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📅 Year-wise and Round-wise filters (Rounds 1 to 7)
- 🎓 Institute-wise filtering with type (IIT/NIT/IIIT) and region
- 🎯 Minimum Opening Rank and Maximum Closing Rank visualizations
- 🧍‍♂️ Category/Seat Type analysis (GEN, OBC, SC, ST, PwD, EWS)
- 📊 Line graphs, bar charts, waterfall charts, and stacked area visuals
- 🧭 Slicers for Quota (Home/Other State/AI) and Gender (GN/Female Supernumerary)
- 🎨 Custom page-wise color-coded themes for round navigation
